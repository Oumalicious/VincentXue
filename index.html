					<p>
						Learning is my driver and motivation. I value moments of blunder because they provide valuable learning experiences.
						You can only grow as a person if you can internalize moments of uneasiness and uncertainty, while recognizing situations that are outside the scope of your abilities.
						I'm equally passionate about coding and my hobbies, so this section is dedicated to my pastimes.
					</p>
					<p>
						I picked up the piano when I was 8. I applied for Mark Twain Intermediate School but failed the entry tests in both math and music.
						My piano teacher at the time was extremely dissapointed, and humiliated me in front of my parents for not making the cut.
						As a result, I learned that classical music has a grey area of elitism and immediately sought to leave the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABRSM">ABRSM</a>.
						I leaned on piano covers I found online and enjoyed piano outside the typical composers like Mozart and Bach.
						I eventually revisited the examination board to complete the last few grades.
						And so, I'm thankful for the embarrassment that I received from my first teacher because it was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect">butterfly effect</a> for the music that I enjoy.
					</p>
					<p>
						Flexible joints and posture are key to running, but I used to be convinced that my body was physically incapable of either.
						My <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_feet">flat feet</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genu_varum">bowed legs</a> make long distance running hurt my feet and many doctors discouraged me from long periods of running.
						While overcomming my mental and physical blockers by participating in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Road_Runners">NYRR</a>, I became infatuated with the world of runners.
						Runners are more diverse than the colors of the rainbow, coming in different sizes and conditions.
						Running aside them gives you a sense of encouragement, positivity, and excitement. As of 2024, I've ran 3 Marathons, biked 2 <a href="https://www.bike.nyc/events/td-five-boro-bike-tour/">Five Boro Bike Tours</a>, and completed 2 sprint triathalons.

					<p>
						My coding journey started at Brooklyn Technical Highschool. In your sophmore year at this specialized highschool, you get to pick your 'major' for the next 2 years.
						Choosing Software Engineering, I learned <span class="italicWord">HTML</span>, <span class="italicWord">CSS</span>,
						<span class="italicWord">Javascript</span>, and <span class="italicWord">Java</span>.
						I got an early understanding of <span class="italicWord">Object Oriented Programming</span> and the <span class="italicWord">SDLC Life Cycle</span>.
						I continued my interest in at Brooklyn College because it was affordable and I worked part-time as a lifeguard.
					</p>
					<p>
						At the start of 2018, I interned as a FullStack Engineer at the <a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program/longterm/cdpap.htm" target = "_blank">CDPAP</a> agency <a href = "https://www.allstarhc.com/" class ="special">Allstar Homecare Agency</a>.
						I was glad to be a part of the CDPAP workforce because <a href="https://www.nysed.gov/career-technical-education/home-health-aide"> Home Health Aides</a> complement the holistic preferences of Chinese culture.
						Traditional Asian households emphasize the importance of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filial_piety">filial piety</a>, so providing a HHA to a family member provides company and a piece of mind.
						My tasks included display HHA and client information (<span class="italicWord">ReactJS</span>, <span class="italicWord">Node.js</span>, and
						<span class="italicWord">MongoDB</span>), stylzing with open-sourced frame works (<span class="italicWord">Elemental.UI</span> and
						<span class="italicWord">AgGrid</span>), and parsing document data (<span class="italicWord">jQuery</span>,
						<span class="italicWord">Moment.js</span>, and <span class="italicWord">PDFtk</span>).
					</p>
					<p>
						TODO
					</p>
					<p>
						My proudest project is an exam simulator with an emphasis of memorization by manipulating the <span class="italicWord">DOM</span> and reading <span class="italicWord">JSON</span> files.
						This app is unique because it's a layered vocabulary memorization tool.
						There are 3 aspects when it comes to learning character based languages: the character itself <span class="chinese">(樂/乐)</span>, pronunciation <span class="chinese">(Lè)</span>, and the translation <span class="chinese">(happy)</span>.
						Initially, this was a whimsical project that helped me study for 1 Chinese test, but I saw its potential to be more dynamic.
						Tests are editable and combinable, can save incorrect answers into a test, and logs the elapsed time per each question.
						I showed the app to my friend who was pursuing a Master's in Occupational Therapy, and it provided positive results.
						I see a future where anybody can use my app to study.
